## SRE Dash

##Goals
Create a dashboard where users can view SLO metrics.
An on call roster and help page will assist users
Login and auth to keep the page secure
Users should be able to set custom SLO goals / objectives
Indications will appear so we can quickly see which goals aren't being met
Clicking on a graph will display the 99% outliers (url, value, count, team)
